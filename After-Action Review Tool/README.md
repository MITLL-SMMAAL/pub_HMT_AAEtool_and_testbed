# After Action Explanations Front End

This is front end code for After Action Explanations in the SMMAAL project. Its purpose is to display the actions of agents (humans and robots) while they are acting as a team in Minecraft, along with an explanation of agent beliefs and intentions at any given time.

It is currently designed to take information from a one-human, one-bot team. Inputs as follows:
- one video of the robot point of view
- one video of the human point of view
- a text file describing a priori background information, e.g. game details, scenario details, agent information, etc
- a text or JSON file describing the sequence of events in the game, as understood by the agent

To install:

You need NPM, then run

`npm install express bootstrap marked`

To run:

Ensure that `node.js` is installed (https://nodejs.org/).

Navigate to this repo's folder then
1. Start the LLM proxy server: `node llm_interface_server.mjs`
2. Run `python aae_frontend.py`
3. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8082` on a browser

The AAE page currently expects the folder `games/minecraft` to be in the root directory, and for the following files to be in that directory:
* `recording.webm`
* `recording_bot.webm`
* `minecraft_gameplay_events.json`
* `minecraft_context.txt` 

These files should be generated by the Minecraft interaction and moved to the `games/minecraft` folder, following the instructions on the post-game loading page before the AAE page is reached.

*Note that as of 11/15 minecraft_gameplay_events.json and minecraft_context are not automatically generated.*
